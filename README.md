# The Simon Game
The game consists of 4 colored buttons. Each button is associated with a particular sound. The game creates a random series of button flashes and sounds and requires a user to repeat the sequence. 

I built this game as a web page for desktop using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and some mp3 sound files.
