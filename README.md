The Simon Game consists of 4 colored buttons. Each button is associated with a particular sound. The game creates a random series of button flashes and sounds and requires a user to repeat the sequence. 

I build this game is a web page for desktop using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and some mp3 sound files.
